## How do I change X about the site?

Do you want to change any of the following?

 - Title of the blog
 - How my name shows up
 - The description that shows up when I share links
 - Display/hide my email

then you can edit a config file [here](https://github.com/ninjha01/alecsite/blob/main/_config.yml).

If you want to change the home page of the blog you can edit that [here](https://github.com/ninjha01/alecsite/blob/main/index.md).

If you want to change something else (the style of the site, say) or you break something ping Nishant.

## How do I do X with markdown?

Look at [this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) and if you're still confused ask Nishant.
